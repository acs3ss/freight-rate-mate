## Project Overview

- Dynamic visualization of truck location data
- Crash risk heat map
- Real-time machine learning based predictive analysis
- Enables carriers and truckers to connect through SMS messaging directly availiable in our interface

Predicting and visualizing trucking risks using machine learning.

## Why is insurance important to truckers?

- Insurance rates can be upward of $16,000 per year
- By knowing high risk factors, insurance companies can provide incentives for truckers to avoid high risk areas
- Our tool is also useful for carriers because it allows them to view information about their fleet and send drivers SMS messages directly from the interface
